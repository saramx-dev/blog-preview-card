## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling  
- **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for layout  
- **Mobile-first** responsive workflow  

### What I learned
I practiced building a responsive component with Tailwind, using for adaptive font sizes and widths. Small details like shadows, spacing, and hover states made the component feel more polished.

### Continued development
In future projects, I plan to focus more on accessibility features (like ARIA labels and keyboard navigation), improving hover transitions, and experimenting with component-driven design using Tailwind and utility-first workflows.

### Useful resources
- Tailwind CSS docs    
- and other online resources
